# Analysis of A/B Test Results for an e-commerce website

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website
to help decide whether to implement a new page, keep the old page,
or perhaps run the experiment longer.


## Dataset
Two datasets are analyzed:
1. ab_data.csv has 294,478 records with 5 column:
- user_id
- timestamp
- group (control or treatment)
- landing_page (old_page or new_page)
- converted (1,0, with 1 meaning converted)

2. countries.csv has 290,584 records with 2 variables
